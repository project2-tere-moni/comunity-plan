# Community-Plan

Common Plans is a platform for citizen participation for the city of Madrid, in which it is possible to decide a use for vacant properties of the city council.

The app allows any citizen to propose a cultural event in one of these empty places. Collective intelligence is used this way to reactivate these spaces and to perform activities in benefit of the community.

You can singup and create your event here: https://comunity-plan.herokuapp.com/
